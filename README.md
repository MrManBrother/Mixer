# Mixer

Takes text files, and remixes them according to matched words

Dependencies are intentionally minimal - most linux/mac setups this should work out of the box - if not feel free to contact me here and I can assist.

## Build
From a freshly cloned area do:

```
source setEnv.sh
make
```

To cleanup, do:

```
make clean
```
